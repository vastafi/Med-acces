                                        <br>
                                        Where the time expired goods which have been returned by the retailer/wholesaler are destroyed by the manufacturer, he/she is required to reverse the
                                        ITC availed on the return supply in terms of section 17(5) (h) of the CGST Act. However, ITC which is required to be reversed in such scenario is the
                                        ITC availed on the return supply and not the ITC that is attributable to the manufacture of such time expired goods.
                                        <br>
                                        <img src="assets/img/proc/proc3.png" alt="My image" />
                                        <br>
                                        <b>Illustration:</b> Supposedly, manufacturer has availed ITC of Rs. 10/- at the time of manufacture of medicines valued at Rs. 100/-. At the time of return
                                        of such medicine on the account of expiry, the ITC available to the manufacturer on the basis of fresh invoice issued by wholesaler is Rs. 15/-.
                                        So, when the time expired goods are destroyed by the manufacturer he would be required to reverse ITC of Rs. 15/- and not of Rs. 10/-.
                                        <b> Note:</b> Most of the cases the Time Expired Goods are Destroyed in a Controlled Manner by the Manufacturer of Pharma / Medicines.
                                        Therefore they need to Reverse the Credit.

                                        <b>  a.</b> As per section 34(1) of the CGST Act, the manufacturer or the wholesaler who has supplied the goods to the wholesaler or retailer,
                                        as the case may be, has the option to issue a credit note in relation to the time expired goods returned by the wholesaler or retailer,
                                        as the case may be.
                                        <br> <b> b.</b> If the credit note is issued within the time limit specified in section 34(2) of the CGST Act, the tax liability may
                                        be adjusted by the supplier, provided the person returning the time expired goods has either not availed the ITC or if availed has reversed
                                        the ITC so availed against the goods being returned. However, if the time limit has expired, a credit note may still be issued but the tax
                                        liability cannot be adjusted by him in his hands
                                        <br>
                                        <b> c.</b> Further, in case they are returned beyond the time period specified and a credit note
                                        is issued, there is no requirement to declare such credit note on the common portal by the supplier as tax liability cannot be adjusted in this case.
